This integration of nature with engineering marvels housed under a striking glass and steel dome is poised to make headlines.

在雅致的谷景私人套房举行亲密的婚礼，这里远离公众视线。套房内设有私人开放式阳台，可俯瞰资生堂森林山谷，山谷中郁郁葱葱的田园风光使浪漫的花园主题更加完美。
对于接待人数较少的宾客的夫妇来说，套房的面积和舒适的装修将是最佳选择。在全面的餐饮合作伙伴的支持下，还可以举办温馨的茶会。

2020s
By 1960, Paya Lebar Airport is handling more than 300,000 passengers and 30,000 aircraft movements a year. It welcomes 11 airlines operating 125 weekly flights. Visitor arrivals to Singapore hit 100,000.
Over the next two years, the runway at Paya Lebar Airport is extended from 2.4km to 2.7km. This makes it one of the longest runways in Asia.
On 1st April 1967, BOAC's Super VC-10, the fastest and most powerful civil jet aircraft of its day, lands at Paya Lebar Airport.
Despite the airport’s growing reputation, the amenities and services at Paya Lebar are still basic and functional. For instance, passengers have to walk up and down mobile steps to embark and disembark their aircraft.
Two years later in 1979, the actual construction of Changi Airport begins with the laying of the foundation stone of the Terminal 1 superstructure.
On 14 July 1979, SIA and the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) sign an agreement to establish air links between the two countries, allowing each airline to operate three flights a week.
Even though Changi Airport only officially commenced operations in 1981, we started a series of firsts in the world.
We were first to introduce the concept of airport gardens, as well as the first to allow passengers to make free local telephone calls in transit, and more.
As an improvement from Paya Lebar Airport, taxi queues were located indoors so passengers were provided with a completely air-conditioned experience from disembarkation to their taxis.
On 30 June 1981, the airport moves from Paya Lebar to its new premises at Changi.
The following day, Terminal 1 officially becomes operational with the arrival of its first flight—SQ101, carrying 140 passengers from Kuala Lumpur —at 0700 hrs. The first departing flight, SQ192, leaves for Penang at 0800 hrs on the same day.
In just two weeks, 250,000 visitors—or 1 in 10 Singaporeans—visit the airport. Paid tours to the restricted area after immigration are conducted at $0.50 per person.
By 1986, Terminal 1 has surpassed the 10 million passenger mark and construction work for Terminal 2 begins.
By the early 1990s, Changi is welcoming 52 airlines operating 1,900 weekly flights to 111 cities in 52 countries. Visitor arrivals hit 5.3 million.
In 1991, Terminal 2 officially opens to accommodate the ever-growing number of passengers. In the same year, the Changi Airport Skytrains are launched to offer passengers an efficient, comfortable connection between the two terminals.
With the dawn of the new millenium, Changi Airport introduces facilities and services catering to a new generation of technology-savvy travellers.
Changi Airport is served by 64 airlines operating 3,400 weekly flights to 145 cities in 50 countries. In October 2000, construction of Terminal 3 begins.
Changi Airport organised the world's first airport gameshow, 'What's Your Range?' in conjunction with the World Cup.
Broadband Internet Access is consolidated at Changi Airport's E-Hub and, by 2004, there were 200 Internet terminals available throughout the airport—a record for airports worldwide.
SMRT officially opens the Changi Airport MRT Station—connecting Changi Airport to Tanah Merah on the East-West (EW) line, bringing another option of commute to the airport.
To facilitate the travel process, flight alerts are also made available to passengers via SMS, and flight information is accessible on mobile devices in 2002.
Spiderman climbs down Changi's 80-metre high Control tower in conjunction with the release of the Spiderman movie in Singapore.
In 2004, Changi Airport carries out a six-month trial of the world's first automated check-in system that integrates the check-in and immigration processes for departing travellers.
In 2006, Changi Airport wins the inaugural Skytrax World Airport Awards' 'World’s Best Airport' title.
On 26 March, the new Budget Terminal opens.
Later in the year, Terminal 2 completes a S$240 million upgrade of its facilities and operational systems.
On 1 July, Changi Airport celebrates its 25th anniversary.
In October 2007, Changi Airport becomes the first airport to welcome the Airbus A380.
SIA becomes the world's first airline to fly the A380 between Singapore and Sydney.
On 1 July 2008, Terminal 3 officially opens. The new terminal features a unique “butterfly” roof which bathes the terminal building in natural sunlight.
Not only does the innovative roof offer passengers a new, relaxing experience, it also creates the environment for the world's first, in-airport Butterfly Garden. The Terminal is now home to more than 1,000 free-roaming butterflies and is a tropical nature retreat.
In May 2008, extensive refurbishments to Terminal 1 are completed at a cost of S$500 million.
Finally, with the Singapore-Kuala Lumpur route fully liberalised, Singaporean and Malaysian carriers are allowed to operate unlimited flights between the two capitals.
In 2010, Changi Airport surpasses the 40 million passenger mark. Intra-regional connectivity in ASEAN is fully established with the commencement of thrice-weekly services between Singapore and Vientiane. Singapore is now connected via direct flights to all nine other ASEAN countries.
The retail promotion, 'Be A Changi Millionaire', was launched. This promotion offered the largest cash prize in Singapore.
In May 2010, Singapore's tallest slide at 10 metres, Slide@T3 opens.
In 2011, the Changi Rewards card programme is introduced to encourage retail and dining spend at the airport.
Changi Airport introduces Changi Experience Ambassadors (CEAs), deploying roving customer service officers across the airport to help visitors and passengers.
In March that year, with the launch of SIA flights to Sao Paolo, Changi Airport is now directly connected to Brazil.
By June 2012, Terminal 1's upgrade works are complete.Kinetic Rain, the world's largest moving sculpture, is unveiled in the Departure Hall. Made up of 1,216 bronze droplets, and measuring 9.8m by 4m, the sculpture can form 16 different abstract forms and recognisable shapes.
In the same year, Budget Terminal is closed to make way for Terminal 4.
The iChangi HD app is launched to provide passengers with real-time access to flight details, terminal maps, and information about airport offerings.
Changi Airport receives its 25th consecutive 'Best Airport' award, from Business Traveller UK.
In 2013, plans for the development of Jewel Changi Airport, Changi East, the three-runway system, and Terminal 5 are announced.
A new online shopping portal, iShopChangi, is introduced to offer passengers greater convenience, comfort and value.
In November that year, construction of Terminal 4 begins.
In December 2014,construction of Jewel Changi Airport begins.

Building for the future to secure Changi Airport’s position as a leading air hub
ABOUT CHANGI EAST
ABOUT TERMINAL 5
MILESTONES
FAQS
Spanning a massive 1,080 hectares, the Changi East development will provide future capacity for Changi Airport. The development will serve to secure Singapore’s air hub status and ensure its continued competitiveness and relevance.
As Changi Airport’s largest expansion project to date, the development includes:
Changi Airport’s fifth terminal, Terminal 5 (T5)
A three-runway system
The construction of tunnels and other underground systems
Landside and aviation support facilities
The Changi East Industrial Zone
Terminal 5 is a project undertaken by Changi Airport Group, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore, and the Ministry of Transport.

T5 will be linked to the other terminals at Changi Airport, allowing the expanded Changi Airport to be operated as a single, integrated airport for ease of transfer between different terminals with airfield operational efficiency. New facilities, such as navigation aids, airfield lighting systems and a fire station will also be constructed.
The existing third runway, previously used only by the military, has been extended from 2.75km to 4km to handle larger passenger aircraft, and converted for joint military-civilian use.Under the three-runway programme, almost 40km of new taxiways will also be built to connect the runway with the rest of Changi Airport. This three-runway system is scheduled for operationalisation by the mid-2020s.
Changi Airport’s cargo facilities, currently located at the Changi Airfreight Centre, will be expanded to the Changi East Industrial Zone (CEIZ) as part of the Changi East Development.The zone will be developed for airfreight, air express and Maintenance, Repair and Operations (MRO) activities. Together with the remodelled Changi Airfreight Centre, Changi’s handling capabilities will increase from 3 million tonnes per annum today, to 5.4 million tonnes per annum in its end-state, when the project is completed.
The future expanded air cargo hub will be smarter, more connected and more efficient. The use of data and technology with a focus on automation will reduce processing time, and improve productivity and cargo visibility.Strategic infrastructure planning will ensure greater operational efficiency, with dedicated lanes for autonomous guided vehicles. Direct access to freighter aircraft from cargo and express terminals will also speed up cargo flows.With environmental and workplace sustainability in mind, the new air cargo hub will feature eco-friendly handling equipment, convenient amenities and a land transport network for staff.
Terminal 5 is an integral part of the Changi East development, which will position Singapore to capture future growth opportunities in the region.

T5 will be a place of shared experiences where precious memories with friends and family are forged.
Terminal 5 (T5) is located within the 1,080-hectare Changi East development. The terminal is designed with the flexibility to be built in two phases, in line with traffic growth. In its first phase, T5 will be able to handle about 50 million passenger movements per year and is expected to be operational around the mid-2030s. It will allow Changi Airport to significantly increase its handling capacity and strengthen its position as a premier air hub as travel demand continues to increase in the decades ahead.
T5 will be linked to the existing terminals at Changi Airport,  so that the airport can operate as a single integrated air hub. It will house a ground transportation centre that brings together train, bus, taxi and other transport services. T5 also offers the possibility of enhanced air and sea connectivity - for more seamless passenger travel, including convenient connections to neighbouring destinations via ferry services.
Drawing on lessons learnt from the Covid-19 pandemic, T5 has also been designed with the flexibility to operate as smaller sub-terminals when needed. Specialised provisions to reduce the transmission of diseases will also be deployed in T5, including contactless systems at passenger touchpoints and enhanced ventilation systems.
As a new gateway to Singapore, T5 offers new possibilities and will bring new surprises. It will reinforce Changi Airport’s status as a national icon and be a place of shared experiences across generations of Singaporeans, where precious memories are forged with friends and family.
T5’s design concept is characterised by a unique collection of overlapping curved roofs with varying heights. The ‘roof leaves’ break the mega terminal building into smaller spaces that are more human scale. Combined with natural light and landscaping at appropriate spaces, the terminal will have a cosy yet uplifting feel.
To make it easier for passengers to get around the terminal, an automated people mover (APM) system will be used to reduce walking distances. Together with travellators,  walking distances in T5 will be comparable to Changi’s current terminals. The APM network will also link T5 to Terminal 2, facilitating seamless transfers to the other terminals.
T5 will leverage technology to automate and digitalise airport operations.   This will enable the airport to operate at scale in a sustainable manner, with reduced reliance on manpower. In addition to various ongoing trials to enhance airport operations via automation, video analytics, AI and robotics are also being trialled for wider implementation in T5.
Video analytics and AI help monitor aircraft turnaround activities and predict potential delays in flight departures. With full visibility of the situation, ground handlers can better deploy resources to mitigate potential delays.

T5 will be a Green Mark Platinum Super Low Energy Building, as certified by the Building and Construction Authority. Powered by a larger share of clean energy, it will be equipped with building management systems that feature innovative and efficient systems design. The terminal will feature one of the largest rooftop solar panel systems in Singapore, which can potentially generate enough energy to power 20,000 4-room HDB flats for a year. T5 will also be ready for environmentally friendly solutions such as providing fixed ground power and district cooling, as well as viable alternative fuels including the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel for aircraft.
For more information about T5, please refer to CAG’s factsheet.
2013
PM Lee Hsien Loong spoke about the plans for T5 and Changi East in his National Day Rally speech. Shortly after, the Changi 2036 Steering Committee, which was established to develop a holistic long-term plan for the expansion of Changi Airport, announces its recommendations to construct Terminal 5 (T5) and implement a three-runway system at Changi.
2014
Land preparation works for Changi East and planning for T5 begin in 2014, including functional design studies and concept development for the terminal.
2018
CAG announces the appointment of the Master Building Consultants (MBC) in 2018, to provide architectural design and engineering consultancy services for the development of T5. The Master Civil Consultants (MCC) are also appointed, to provide consultancy services for the design of infrastructure at the landside and airside areas outside of the T5 buildings.
2020
A two-year pause of the T5 project is announced in 2020, due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The aim is to assess the impact of Covid-19 on aviation growth, learn from the pandemic experience, and review T5’s design to meet the needs of post-pandemic travel.
2022
The resumption of work on the T5 project is announced in 2022. MOT, CAAS and CAG have taken the opportunity of the two-year pause to comprehensively review the T5 design to make it more modular, resilient and sustainable. Construction of T5 will commence in about two years for T5 to meet the anticipated demand for air travel around the mid-2030s.
2025
PM Lawrence Wong breaks ground for Terminal 5. Works will start thereafter. Several contracts for remaining buildings, civil works and systems are expected to be launched in the next few years.

Efficient operations and management ensure our airport runs like clockwork.
24/7, 365 days a year, the airport never sleeps. Together with our airport partners, our operations team works relentlessly so that passengers travelling through Changi Airport always enjoy a stress-free experience.
Creating amagicalexperience at Changi Airport is at the heart of everything we do. We offer a wide array of facilities, such as movie theatres, entertainment zones, snooze lounges and gardens. Like our clean and green city, our terminals are also filled with lush greenery..
Planning ahead gets us ready to tackle future challenges and demands. As such, we design new passenger terminals that can adapt to future changes, as well as enhance and transform the passenger experience. One of the bold and revolutionary ideas we implemented is Fast and Seamless Travel (FAST). Now in fulloperationat Changi Airport, the automated system allows passengers to print their boarding passes and bag tags, as well as check in their luggages themselves.
Airside Management makes it safe for aircrafts to take off, land, and taxi at Changi and Seletar Airport.The airside operations team is responsible for many complex and vital tasks on the runways, taxiways, aprons, and beyond airport fences. These tasks include the allocation of aircraft stands and baggage claim belts, testing and issuance of airside driving and vehicular permits, safety inspections, responding to accidents and incidents, audits to mitigate unsafe work practices and wildlife hazard management.

To operate any vehicle within Changi Airport's airside, a driver must obtain an Airside Driving Permit.
As part of CAG’s ongoing efforts to enhance safety at Changi's Airside, we have introduced the Airside Safety Induction Briefing.

A meticulous adherence to technicalities is something we treat seriously and take pride in. Connecting passengers across our terminals seamlessly is no easy feat. We constantly keep a close watch to ensure that our systems operate smoothly every minute of the day.

We work with the best to employ the newest technologies and excellent hardware to ensure the safety of all passengers.

Even amid inflation and fierce competition, we are excited and confident in our future togetherness, knowing this partnership is built on mutual dedication and trust.

E-COMMERCE
Southeast Asia’s e-commerce market has been forecasted to grow at a CAGR of over 20%, tripling its size today to US$230 billion in gross merchandise volume by 2026. Equipped with efficient, purpose-fit, and smart sorting and processing capabilities, Changi Airfreight Centre enables operators to connect international e-commerce cargo at speed for faster delivery and improved traceability.
In April 2017, SATS unveiled a S$21 million eCommerce AirHub. The 6,000m2 facility houses state-of-the-art innovations and technology aimed at improving productivity. A fully automated mail sorting system increases the mailbag process capacity of SATS to more than 1,800 an hour. A direct integration with SingPost’s airmail consignment operations and the facility’s location within the Free Trade Zone on the airside reduces turnaround time by 50 percent from six to three hours. This enables international e-commerce mail to connect to earlier flights for faster delivery.

Our people are our most important asset in our mission to be the world's leading airport company and a vibrant air hub.
Together, we are Changi Airport Group:
Come make MAGIC with us.
We offer a unique work environment in a global, vibrant and exciting airport community. With a set-up of multiple businesses, we present challenging work and diverse opportunities for our employees to further their personal and professional growth. Our employees are provided with a platform to develop and see through their ideas and contributions, which make an impact to our organisation and to the communities we serve locally and globally.
Join Us
The Randstad Employer Brand Awards recognises Singapore’s most attractive employers, based on the perceived attractiveness of 75 of the largest commercial companies (by employee size) in Singapore. In 2016 and 2018, we were named Singapore’s Most Attractive Employer by Randstad and remains consistently among the Top 10 employers.
In 2017, we embarked on a Workplace Transformation initiative and turned the traditional office space into one that facilitates collaboration and innovation. Our new workplace features open-concept workstations, beautiful pantries, and meeting areas that cater to both formal meetings as well as casual chats over a cup of coffee.
Terminal H (where "H" stands for the heart of the company) is the core of our people strategy to build deep engagement with - and among - our people. Some of the initiatives include "Fun Friday", where employees come together and bond over fun and thematic activities, such as art jamming sessions. We also have an extensive workplace wellness programme to promote healthy living, with complimentary fitness classes, cooking classes, and more.
Our people’s ability to grow professionally and personally is important to us. We strive to help our employees reach their highest potential, and encourage them to take a proactive role in learning and development. We conduct programmes that create opportunities to enhance their professional and management skills, knowledge and abilities. For example, the annual Learning Festival—a week-long festival packed with workshops and talks by various high profile industry speakers, created a conducive environment for active sharing and learning.

She quickly arranged for medical attention, reassured the passenger’s panicked husband, and ensured they were swiftly taken to the clinic for care. Zaleha stayed by their side until the passenger was assessed as fit to fly and personally escorted them to their flight thereafter. Her calm demeanour and compassionate approach not only eased their anxiety but ensured they continued their journey smoothly.
When a passenger and her son missed their flight due to visa issues, Cathy stepped in to support them while awaiting further instructions. She kindly provided biscuits, drinks, and blankets to ensure they stayed comfortable and warm. Cathy’s genuine care turned an anxious situation into a less stressful one for the family.

You can withdraw such consent at any time by contacting our data protection officer at the contact details set out in this Policy.
Depending on the extent to which you withdraw consent, such withdrawal of consent may result in our inability to provide the relevant services to you and may be considered as a termination by you of any agreement between CAG and you.

Understand how we manage the safety and security of our stakeholders' data.
Vulnerability Disclosure Policy
The safety and security of our stakeholders’ data (including customers, employees, partners and suppliers), and the reliability of our products and services, are important toChangi Airport Group (S) Pte. Ltd. (“CAG”).Therefore, we aim to design and develop products and services with high levels of security and reliability. Despite our best efforts, due to the complex and sophisticated nature of our products and services, vulnerabilities and errors may still be present. CAG’s vulnerability disclosure program is part of our efforts to enhance its cybersecurity posture, especially as it relates to our products and services. This VDP describes CAG’s vulnerability disclosure program and sets outCAG’sapproach to requesting and receiving reports related to potential vulnerabilities and errors in our products and services. This VDP also outlines the terms and conditions for responsible vulnerability reporting.
Products and services in this VDP refer to digital products and services provided by CAG through [https://www.changiairport.comandhttps://www.ishopchangi.com/].
Please note that CAG’s vulnerability disclosure program does not authorise, permit or endorse the taking of any action which may contravene applicable laws and regulations such as the Computer Misuse Act 1993. For the avoidance of doubt, any attempt to exploit or test suspected vulnerabilities such as by gaining unauthorised access to any computer/data is strictly prohibited, and neither permitted nor encouraged.
To report a vulnerability, please click on the ‘Submit a report’ button at the bottom of this page. Please note that reporting any vulnerability or error (including supplying your personal data and contact information) is entirely voluntary. By submitting a report, you hereby consent for your personal data (including your name, email address) to be collected, used and/or disclosed by members of the CAG Group to assess the report that you have submitted and for the purposes set out in Changi Airport Group (Singapore) Pte. Ltd.'s (CAG)Privacy Policy.
TERMS AND CONDITIONSBy submitting a report toCAG, or otherwise communicating to CAG regarding any vulnerabilities and errors, you agree that:
CAG may use your report for any purpose deemed relevant byCAG, including without limitation, to correct any vulnerabilities and errors that you report, and without any attribution, credit or remuneration to you or any consultation with you.
You have not exploited or used in any manner, and will not exploit or use in any manner other than for the purposes of reporting toCAG, the discovered vulnerabilities and/or errors.
You have not engaged, and will not engage, in any actions (including testing/reconnaissance of systems) with the intention of harmingCAG, its customers, employees, partners or suppliers.
You have not used, misused, deleted, altered or destroyed, and will not use, misuse, delete, alter or destroy, any data that you have accessed or may be able to access in relation to the vulnerability and/or error discovered.
You have not conducted, and will not conduct social engineering, spamming, phishing, denial-of-service or resource-exhaustion attacks, as it relates to CAG’s products and services.
You have not breached, and will not breach, any applicable laws (such as the Computer Misuse Act 1993) in relation to and in connection with the submission of your report to CAG.
You will not disclose to any third party any information related to your report, the vulnerabilities and/or errors reported, nor the fact that a vulnerability and/or error has been reported toCAG.
CAGdoes not guarantee that you will receive any response fromCAGrelated to your report.CAGwill only contact your regarding your report if CAG (at its absolute discretion) deems it necessary.
You agree that you are making your report without any expectation or requirement of reward or other benefit, financial or otherwise, and without any expectation that the vulnerabilities and/or errors reported are corrected by CAG.
You will comply with the Code of Conduct for Participants of CAG’s Vulnerability Disclosure Programme.
CAG shall not be liable for any expense, damage or loss of any kind which you may incur due to any action taken or not taken by us in relation to any vulnerability or error you may report.
CAG shall not accept or assume any responsibility for the contents of any report you submit, or shall our acknowledgment or processing of such report constitute any kind of acceptance or endorsements of the contents of your report.
A proof of concept regarding the reported vulnerability should not be malicious in nature, for example, but not limited to the following: tampering of existing data in database, adding bogus records in the database, or deletion of records. In the case where SQL injection vulnerability exist, querying for the version of database would be sufficient to demonstrate the ability to read database. Enumerating the existing rights in context of the SQL server session is also allowed. In time-based SQL context, showing that the response time varies and correspond to the different values set in sleep function would suffice. Showing hostname is sufficient for RCE vulnerabilities.
You agree not to establish persistence by all means. A reverse shell or C2 connection back to your own C2 Infrastructure is strictly forbidden.
CODE OF CONDUCT FOR PARTICIPANTS OF CAG’S VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE PROGRAMME
Participants should act responsibly and with the sole purpose of reporting suspected vulnerabilities and errors.
Participants shall avoid any kind of harm, damage or loss to individuals or organisations. These could be any actions that may cause interruption to or degradation of any services such as brute forcing as well as Distributed Denial of Service (“DDoS”) attacks.
Participants shall not attempt to exfiltrate any computer data or publish details or publicly disclose any suspected vulnerabilities or errors to any third party apart from CAG.
Upon detecting any vulnerability or error in CAG’s products or services, kindly notify CAG immediately by clicking the ‘Submit a report’ button at the bottom of the page.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT CHANGI AIRPORT EARLY CHECK-IN
What options are available for early check-in at Changi Airport, and how do they differ from regular check-in?
At Changi Airport, passengers have the option to check in early for added convenience. Early check-in allows travellers to drop off their baggage and receive their boarding passes ahead of their scheduled departure, starting from 3 to 24 hours before the flight. This service is particularly beneficial for those who want to explore the airport’s amenities or simply avoid the last-minute rush. Unlike regular check-in, which opens about 2 to 3 hours before departure, early check-in provides more flexibility and reduces time spent in queues.
Can passengers complete the early check-in process online for all airlines operating out of Changi Airport, or are there exceptions?
Most airlines operating out of Changi Airport offer the option to check in online, allowing passengers to select their seats and print their boarding passes from the convenience of their home or office. However, there are exceptions, and some smaller or charter airlines might not provide this service. Passengers are advised to check with their respective airlines directly for specific online check-in availability.
Are there any specific requirements or documents needed to complete online check-in for flights departing from Changi Airport?
To complete online check-in for flights departing from Changi Airport, passengers will need their booking reference or ticket number and the passport details of all travellers. Some airlines may also require travellers to enter visa details or other travel documentation depending on their destination. It’s important to have all necessary documents handy at the time of online check-in to ensure a smooth process.
How can passengers with special needs or requests, such as extra baggage or special assistance, manage these needs when checking in online?
When checking in online, passengers with special needs or additional requests can manage these preferences through the airline’s website. Most airline interfaces offer options to add extra baggage, request assistance at the airport, or make other necessary arrangements. If specific needs aren’t addressed on the online check-in platform, passengers should contact the airline directly to ensure all accommodations are in place before arriving at the airport.
What steps should passengers follow if they encounter issues during the online check-in process?
If passengers encounter any difficulties during the online check-in process, it's important to address the issue promptly to ensure a smooth and stress-free journey. Here are the steps you should follow:
Check Your Internet Connection: Sometimes, issues can be as simple as a faulty internet connection. Ensure your device is connected to a stable internet service to avoid interruptions during the check-in process.
Verify Your Details: Double-check the accuracy of all required information, such as your booking reference, ticket number, and passport details. Errors in these entries can prevent successful check-in.
Consult the Airline's FAQ or Help Section: Most airline websites have a FAQ or help section where common issues with online check-in are addressed. This can be a quick way to solve your problem without needing to contact customer service.
Contact the Airline Directly: If the above steps do not resolve the issue, contact the airline's customer service for assistance. Have your booking details ready to facilitate a quick resolution. Airlines typically offer support via phone, email, or live chat.
Visit the Jewel Early Check-In Lounge: If you encounter technical difficulties during the online check-in process and cannot resolve them through digital means, head over to the Jewel Early Check-in Lounge at Changi Airport to check in.
By following these steps, passengers can effectively address issues encountered during online check-in, minimising delays and ensuring that their travel plans remain on track.
For passengers using early check-in, where can they drop off their luggage at Changi Airport, and during what hours is this service available?
For passengers who opt for early check-in at the Jewel Early Check-in Lounge, luggage can be conveniently dropped off at the counters located within the lounge itself.
For passengers with odd-sized baggage, passengers flying on airlines departing from Terminal 1 may check in their odd-sized baggage at Jewel Early Check-in Lounge (except Scoot and Qatar Airways). For passengers flying on airlines departing from Terminals 2-4, please proceed to the check-in row at the main terminal for assistance.
However, if passengers choose to check in online, they’ll need to drop off their luggage at their airline’s designated check-in row in the departures hall of the corresponding terminal at Changi Airport. The luggage drop-off service at both locations is typically available from 12 to 24 hours before the flight’s departure, but hours may vary depending on the airline and terminal
After completing online check-in, what are the next steps passengers must take upon arriving at Changi Airport?
After completing online check-in, may proceed to drop off any checked baggage at the Jewel Early Check-in Lounge, or at the designated airline counters.. Following luggage drop-off, passengers can head straight to the security checkpoint and proceed to immigration. Once cleared, they’re invited to enjoy Changi Airport’s numerousairport eateriesandpopular outletsin the transit halls.
For those seeking a quiet and comfortable place to relax, Changi Airport’s snooze lounges offer a serene environment where travellers can unwind or catch up on work before their flight. This lounge is equipped with comfortable seating, high-speed internet, and other amenities to enhance your waiting experience at the airport.

What to know and look out for, to clear immigration swiftly.
Automated Immigration Clearance
GST Refund
Reporting Cash
For express immigration self-clearance, travellers can use the automated gates.
All travellers can enjoy the convenience of automated clearance when they depart Singapore via Changi Airport if their biometrics have been enrolled during arrival immigration clearance.
Travellers can use automated clearance as long as they hold a valid International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) compliant passport.
For more information, please refer toICA’s website
When you buy goods in Singapore, you are required to pay GST on your purchases if the retailer is registered for GST.The Tourist Refund Scheme (TRS) allows you to claim a refund of the GST that you paid on goods purchased from the participating retailers if they are brought out of Singapore via Changi Airport or Seletar Airport, subject to the criteria and conditions of the scheme.
When you buy goods in Singapore, you are required to pay GST on your purchases if the retailer is registered for GST.
The Tourist Refund Scheme (TRS) allows you to claim a refund of the GST that you paid on goods purchased from the participating retailers if they are brought out of Singapore via Changi Airport or Seletar Airport, subject to the criteria and conditions of the scheme.
How does the Electronic Tourist Refund Scheme (eTRS) work?
The Tourist Refund Scheme (TRS) allows eligible tourists to claim a refund of the GST that you paid on goods purchased from the participating retailers if they are brought out of Singapore via Changi Airport or Seletar Airport.
To be eligible for a GST refund under this scheme, you must satisfy all the following criteria:
You are 16 years of age or above on the date of the purchase;
You are not a citizen or a permanent resident of Singapore;
You are not a member of the crew of an aircraft on which you are departing Singapore; and
You are not a Specified Person* -on the date of the purchase;at any time within the period of 3 months immediately before the date of purchase; oron the date you submit your claim for a refund of the GST charged on your purchases at the airport;
on the date of the purchase;
at any time within the period of 3 months immediately before the date of purchase; or
on the date you submit your claim for a refund of the GST charged on your purchases at the airport;
*For the definition of Specified Person, please refer to the GST Refund Guide for Visitors on Tourist Refund Scheme (link below)
The eTRS is a paperless process; you will not receive any eTRS ticket, and purchases will be tagged to your passport. If you wish to claim GST Refund on your purchases, you should present your passport to the retailers upon payment. To review or select your purchases for GST Refund, you may wish to visit the e-services portal athttps://touristrefund.sg.
Applying for GST Refund can be done at GST Refund facilities at the terminal of your departure. For claims on items to be checked-in, GST Refund has to be done before your flight check-in. For claims on hand-carried items, GST Refund has to be done in departure transit after clearing immigration.
Don’t forget to collect your original receipt or invoice before leaving the shop.
Which retailers participate in eTRS?
As eTRS is a voluntary scheme, not all retailers in Singapore operate the scheme. GST-registered retailers may choose to operate the scheme on their own or engage the services of a Central Refund Agency.There are currently three Central Refund Agencies in Singapore:Global Blue Singapore Pte. Ltd.
Global Blue retailers affiliated with this agency display a 'Global Blue' sign in their shops.
Website:http://www.globalblue.com/
Global Tax Free Pte. Ltd.
Global Tax Free retailers affiliated with this agency display a 'Global Tax Free' sign in their shops.
Website:http://www.global-taxfree.com.sg
Retailers who operate the scheme on their own usually display signs that indicate 'Tax Refund' in their shops. However, it is best that you check with the retailers if they are operating the scheme.
How much GST refund can I receive?
The actual amount refunded may be lesser than the GST you have paid as a handling fee for the refund service will be deducted by the retailer, Central Refund Agency or operator of Central Refund Counter.
How do I obtain my GST refund?
Do arrive at the airport early to allow sufficient time for your GST refund to be processed and goods to be inspected, if necessary. You are required to seek endorsement at the Customs Inspection Counter in the terminal where you will be checking-in your goods or where your flight will be departing from. You must also depart with the goods on a flight within 12 hours after obtaining approval of your GST refund.
For check-in items:Prior to checking-in the goods, please proceed to the eTRS self-help kiosk at the Departure Check-in Hall (before Departure Immigration) to apply for GST Refund.
For hand-carried items:Please proceed to the eTRS self-help kiosk at Departure Transit Lounge (after Departure Immigration) to apply for GST Refund.
At the kiosk, you will be asked to:
Select your preferred language
Scan your passport
Declare your eligibility and acceptance of the TRS conditions
Select / Deselect the purchases you wish to apply for GST Refund
Select your refund options; Cash, Credit Card or Alipay
Once you have completed the steps above, you will be shown the status of your refund on the kiosk. If your purchases need to be inspected, please proceed to the Customs Inspection Counter for the physical inspection of the goods. Please present the goods, together with your passport, the original invoice(s) or receipt(s) and your confirmed flight itinerary or boarding pass to the Customs Inspection Counter for endorsement.
Refund via Credit CardThe approved refund amount will be credited to the specified credit card within 10 calendar days.

Frequently Asked Questions
How do I enjoy the free daily complimentary parking for Gold and Platinum members?
Free daily parking benefit for Gold and Platinum members will be automatically credited to member’s IU on a daily basis. Members are required to input or update your In-Vehicle Unit (IU) number in your Changi Rewards profile through the Changi App to receive the daily parking benefits. ​

As a Gold/Platinum member, can I split my daily complimentary parking privileges across multiple visits on the same day?
No, the daily complimentary parking hour(s) for Gold and Platinum members shall not be prorated based on the actual amount of time parked. The full hours of free parking (1 hour for Gold member and 2 hours for Platinum member) will be utilised upon the member’s first exit from the carpark during the day (i.e. if a Gold member parks for 30 minutes, the full hours of free 1 hour parking will be utilised upon his exit.

FAQS
Participating Airlines
What is the Changi Baggage Tracker?
The baggage tracker is a service by CAG to provide departing, arriving and transferring passengers with status updates of their bags as they travel through Changi Airport.
I have keyed in my bag tag number but my bag cannot be found.
Your airline(s) may not be participating on the baggage tracker (seeherefor list of participating airlines), but we are continually working with the airlines operating at Changi Airport to bring as many airlines onboard as possible. If you believe that this is an error, please emailenquiry@changiairport.com, or give feedback through the widget found in the baggage tracker.
How long after my flight would I be able to track my bags?
Up to 3 days.
Is this service different from the baggage tracking provided by my airline?
The information provided by your airline and our tracker could be similar. Your airline may provide additional information only available to them, while our tracker may have information displayed that is integrated with our airport facilities.
What does “loaded” mean?
The “loaded” status refers to your checked-in bags being placed into containers / trolleys bound for your departing aircraft.
How are the bags tracked?
The Changi Baggage Tracker utilises a combination of information provided by the airline you travel on and Changi Airport’s baggage system to provide you with a journey of your bags through Changi Airport.
I’m a transfer passenger, why does the tracker show that my bags will be delivered to a belt in Changi Airport?
Please check at the transfer counter to confirm that your bags have been checked through to the final destination.

关于樟宜机场提前值机的常见问题
樟宜机场有哪些提前值机选择，它们与正常办理值机有何不同？
在樟宜机场，为了方便起见，旅客可以选择提前值机。旅客办理提前值机，可在航班起飞前 3 至 24 小时托运行李并领取登机牌。对于想探索机场设施，或是不想在最后一刻匆忙值机的人来说，这项服务特别有用。与起飞前 2 到 3 小时开始正常办理值机不同，提前值机更加灵活，减少了排队的时间。
樟宜机场所有航空公司的旅客都可以在网上完成提前值机流程吗，是否有例外情况？
在樟宜机场运营的大多数航空公司都提供网上值机服务，方便乘客在家里或办公室提前选择座位、打印登机牌。然而，也有例外，一些小型或包机航空公司可能不提供此项服务。建议旅客直接联系所搭乘航班的航空公司，了解可否线上值机。
对于从樟宜机场出发的航班，要完成线上值机，是否有特定要求或需要特定的证件？
对于从樟宜机场出发的航班，要完成线上值机，旅客需要准备好预订参考号、机票编号以及所有旅客的护照详细信息。有些航空公司可能还会要求旅客根据目的地，输入签证详细信息或其他旅行证件。线上值机时一定要准备好所有必要的证件，以便顺利完成值机。
线上值机时，有特殊需求或请求的旅客如何满足这些需求，例如额外的行李或是需要特殊协助？
线上值机时，旅客如有特殊需求或额外请求，可以通过航空公司的网站管理这些偏好。大多数航空公司的网站界面都提供添加额外行李、请求机场协助或做出其他必要安排的选项。如果线上值机平台无法满足特定需求，旅客应直接联系航空公司，确保抵达机场之前一切安排妥当。
旅客如在线上值机过程中遇到任何问题，应当遵照哪些步骤？
旅客如在线上值机过程中遇到任何困难，一定要及时解决问题，确保旅途顺利无忧。您需要遵循下列步骤：
检查互联网连接：有时，可能只是网络连接故障这么简单的问题。确保您的设备连接稳定的互联网服务，避免在值机过程中中断。
核对您的详细信息：仔细检查所有必需的信息是否准确无误，例如您的预订参考号、机票编号和护照详细信息。如有错误，会造成无法成功值机。
查阅航空公司的“常见问题”或“帮助”选项：大多数航空公司的网站都有常见问题或帮助选项，可以解决线上值机常遇到的问题。这可能是快速解决问题的途径，且无需联系客服。
直接联系航空公司：如果上述步骤无法解决问题，请联系航空公司客服来寻求帮助。请准备好您的预订详细信息，以便快速解决问题。航空公司通常会通过电话、电子邮件或实时聊天提供支持。
前往星耀樟宜提前值机大厅：如果您在线上值机时遇到技术问题，且无法通过数字化方式解决，请前往樟宜机场星耀樟宜提前值机大厅办理值机手续。
遵循上述步骤，旅客可有效解决线上值机时遇到的问题，尽量减少延误，确保旅行计划如期进行。
提前值机的旅客可以在樟宜机场的什么地方托运行李，该项服务什么时候提供？
选择在星耀樟宜提前值机大厅提前值机的旅客，可在大厅内的值机柜台托运行李，非常方便。
对于携带特殊行李（例如高尔夫球包、轮椅、婴儿车等）的旅客，如果您搭乘从 1 号航站楼（T1）出发的航班（酷航和卡塔尔航空除外），您可以在星耀樟宜提前值机大厅办理托运。乘坐从 2 至 4 号航站楼出发的航班的乘客，请前往主航站楼的值机区寻求帮助。然而，如果旅客选择线上值机，则需前往其航空公司指定的樟宜机场相应航站楼离境大厅值机柜台托运行李。这两处通常在航班起飞前 12 至 24 小时提供行李托运服务，但时间可能因航空公司和航站楼而异
旅客完成了线上值机，抵达樟宜机场后下一步该怎么做？
完成樟宜机场提前值机后，旅客应先在指定的航空公司柜台放下托运的行李。行李托运后，旅客可直接到安检口，办理出入境手续。完成后，即可体验樟宜机场的众多机场餐馆和离境转机大厅内的人气商品。
如果想找一个安静舒适的地方放松休息，樟宜机场休息区环境宁静，可供旅客放松身心或赶在起飞前完成工作。休息区设有舒适的座椅、高速互联网和其他设施，力求提升您的候机体验。

退税服务
在新加坡购买商品时，如零售商进行了消费税（GST）登记，您则需为购买的商品支付 GST。游客退税计划（TRS）使您可以要求退回为商品支付的消费税，条件是您在参与该方案的零售商处购买了商品，且将商品通过樟宜国际机场或实里达机场（Seletar Airport）带出新加坡；此外，您还需遵守该计划的条款和适用条件。

电子游客退税计划 (eTRS) 是如何运作的？
游客退税计划（TRS）使您可以要求退回为商品支付的消费税，条件是您在参与该计划的零售商处购买了商品，且将商品通过樟宜机场或实里达机场（Seletar Airport）带出新加坡。
您必须满足下列所有条件，方可获得本计划的退税服务：
购物之日年满 16 岁；
非新加坡公民或永久居民；
并非您搭乘的新加坡离境航班的机组人员；以及
您并非指定人员* -在购物之日；在购物之日前 3 个月内；或者在您提交要求退回在机场购物时缴纳的消费税申请之日；
在购物之日；
在购物之日前 3 个月内；或者
在您提交要求退回在机场购物时缴纳的消费税申请之日；
*有关指定人员的定义，请参阅游客退税计划的游客退税指南（链接如下）
eTRS 是无纸化流程；您不会收到任何 eTRS 票据，所购物品的标签会贴在您的护照上。如果想退税，应在付款时向零售商出示您的护照。要查看或选择要退税的物品，请转到https://touristrefund.sg访问电子服务门户。
您可在出发航站楼的退税服务设施申请退税。如要求退税的物品需要托运，请在航班值机前完成退税。如手提行李要退税，则需在通关后在离境转机区域完成退税。
离开店铺前，不要忘记带走您的原始收据/发票。
哪些零售商参与 eTRS？
由于 eTRS 为自愿参与的计划，并不是所有在新加坡的零售商都在实施这一计划。进行消费税登记的零售商可能选择自行运作该计划，或参与中央退税代理机构的服务。目前，新加坡有两家中央退税代理机构：环球蓝联（新加坡）私人有限公司 Ltd.
附属于该代理机构的环球蓝联零售商会在店面展示“环球蓝联（Global Blue）”标志。
网站：http://www.globalblue.com/
Global Tax Free Pte. Ltd.
聘用这家机构服务的零售商会在店内展示“Global Tax Free”标贴。
网站：http://www.global-taxfree.com.sg
自行运作该计划的零售通常会在其店面展示“退税”标志。但是，您最好与零售商确认其是否运作该计划。
我可以获得多少 GST 退税？
退税的实际数额可能少于您支付的消费税，因为零售商、中央退税代理机构或中央退税柜台运营者会扣减一部分退税服务手续费。
我如何获得我的 GST 退税？
请务必提早到达机场，以便为处理您的消费税退税，以及必要时对商品的检查提供足够的时间。在您托运商品的航站楼或航班出发的航站楼，您需寻求海关检查柜台的批准。此外，您必须在获取消费税退税许可后 12 小时内携带退税商品离境。
对于托运物品：在托运商品前，请前往离境登机手续办理大厅（离境大厅前）的 eTRS 自助服务终端申请消费税退税。
对于随身物品：请前往离境登机手续办理大厅（离境大厅前）的 eTRS 自助服务终端申请消费税退税。
服务终端会要求您：
选择您的首选语言
扫描您的护照
表明您符合游客退税计划（TRS）的资格，并接受 TRS 的条件
选择/取消选择您要申请退税的物品
选择您的退款选项；现金、信用卡或 Alipay
您完成上述步骤后，会立即收到服务终端发给您的通知单，表明您的退税状态。如果您购买的物品需要经过检查，请前往海关检查柜台接受商品检查。请向海关检查柜台出示商品、您的护照、原始发票或收据以及确认的航班行程或登机牌，方可同意退税。
信用卡退款获批退款金额将在 10 个日历日内记入指定信用卡。
现金退款请前往离境转机大厅贵宾室（出发离境大厅后方）的退税服务柜台领取现金。
通过 Alipay 退款按照说明到服务终端或柜台收取您的 Alipay 退款。
我在哪里可以领取我的 GST 退税？
公共区域和过境区域都设有退税柜台，每天 24 小时提供服务。
1 号航站楼（T1）

顺畅通过机场安全检查的重要须知。
禁止携带物品
液体、喷雾和凝胶
在旅途中，为了保护您和亲人的安全，作为国际安全措施的一部分，有些物品可能禁止带上飞机。如不遵守这些措施将触犯法律，因为机上其他乘客的安全可能受到威胁。
一般来说，登机时不得携带下列物品。请注意，这些清单并不详尽。
手提行李指南
含烃类气体的卷发器每人仅限携带一个。安全罩须全程牢固地扣在加热元件外。不可单独携带此类卷发器的充气瓶。
安全火柴或打火机仅可随身携带。打火机中只允许装有浓缩液体或液化燃气燃料。禁止携带充气瓶。
电动轮椅仅可作为托运行李。请提前联系您的航空公司，了解是否符合特殊情况。
限制适用于手提行李中的液体、喷雾和凝胶（LAGs）。对于前往欧盟机场（包括瑞士）的旅客，鉴于欧盟的安全措施限制，只有在新加坡樟宜机场转机大厅内购买的带 SGP 国家代码的防篡改密封安全袋（STEB）内的免税物件才允许带上飞机。如有疑问，请在登机前联系您的航空公司。
美国运输安全管理局（TSA）规定，凡搭乘美国航空公司或直达美国班机的乘客，禁止在随身行李内的单一容器中存放 350 毫克（毫升）及以上的粉状物。如果您携带超过这个数量的粉状物，需将它们放入托运行李中。例外情况包括：安全加封透明袋（STEB）包装中的免税商品。可能会有限制。请向您的航空公司查询是否有其他限制。人体遗骸。婴儿奶粉（若您携带婴儿同行）。医生处方证明的药物。随身行李中的所有粉状物，可能需要接受进一步的检查。请在起飞前征询您所搭乘航班航空公司的建议。

人体遗骸。
婴儿奶粉（若您携带婴儿同行）。
医生处方证明的药物。随身行李中的所有粉状物，可能需要接受进一步的检查。请在起飞前征询您所搭乘航班航空公司的建议。
新加坡施行的指南限制了乘客手提行李可携带的液体、喷雾和凝胶（LAGs）数量。不符合该指南的 LAGs 必须托运。
LAGs 指南
这些规定适用于所有从新加坡出发的航班。
在樟宜机场购买的容器容量超过 100 毫升的 LAG，应密封在商店提供的防篡改密封安全袋内，并且密封袋内应明示收据。
LAGs 的示例
饮料（如水或果汁等）
汤和酱料
香水和香体产品（液体或者液固混合物）
面霜、香脂、乳液和精油
化妆品（如睫毛膏或唇彩）
糊状物（例如牙膏）
加压泡沫与喷雾（如剃须泡沫、发胶或除臭喷雾剂等）
凝胶（如发胶、沐浴露等）
隐形眼镜清洗液
含液体内容物的罐头食品
任何其他具有类似一致性的物品
在樟宜购买 LAGs
在公共区域购物如果您在樟宜机场公共区域的商店购买了 LAGs，请在办理航班值机手续前，将这些物品置于托运行李中。如果每个 LAGs 容器的最大容量均未超过 100 毫升，您可以将它们放入容量 1 升的可重复密封的透明塑料袋内随身携带，塑料袋必须完全封闭。
在离境转机大厅购物在樟宜机场离境转机大厅的商店，您可继续购买 LAGs，如烈酒、葡萄酒、啤酒、香水和化妆品等。
请确保将在樟宜机场购买的容器容量超过 100 毫升的 LAGs 密封在防篡改密封安全袋内，并且这些密封袋内应明示收据。
如果您所购买商品的容器最大容量均未超过 100 毫升，您可选择将它们放入容量 1 升的可重复密封的透明塑料袋内随身携带，塑料袋必须完全封闭。
如您要在其他机场中转或过境，请确认适用于这些机场的限制。
请务必与樟宜机场商店人员联系，了解详细信息。
购买 LAGs 的截止时间
如果您要前往澳大利亚、美国，或乘坐美国联合航空公司的航班，我们强烈建议您与您的航空公司联系，了解您是否有资格在樟宜购买 LAGs（仅限烈酒、香水和化妆品），或参考此指南。如果您具备购买资格，则必须在出发时间前至少 90 分钟完成购买。其他所有旅客在出发时间前，均无在樟宜机场购买 LAGs 的截止时间限制。

常见问题
黄金级及铂金级会员如何享有每日免费停车福利？
黄金级及铂金级会员享有的每日免费停车福利，将每日自动存入会员的车内阅卡器（IU）。会员必须通过 Changi App，在其樟宜奖励计划个人档案中输入或更新 IU 号码，以便获得每日停车福利。
当车辆驶出停车场时，相当于免费停车时间的停车费将自动从实际的停车费中扣除。
作为黄金级/铂金级会员，我能否在同一天的多次停车中分开使用每日免费停车特权？
黄金级与铂金级会员的每日免费停车时间不会根据实际停车时间进行分配。全部免费停车时数（黄金级会员 1 小时；铂金级会员 2 小时）将在会员当天首次驶出停车场时用完（即如果黄金级会员只停车 30 分钟，在驶出时将用完 1 小时的免费停车时间。会员如果在同一天第二次驶入指定停车场，将不能享有剩余的 30 分钟免费停车时间）。
所有级别会员如何凭最低消费额享有免费停车福利？
通过 Changi App 输入或更新您的车内阅卡器（IU）号码到您在樟宜奖励计划的个人档案。如果樟宜奖励计划会员档案中没有注册 IU 号码，会员将无法享有停车福利。
光顾樟宜机场及星耀樟宜的参与商家并消费。
在参与商家交易时扫描您的奖励卡，以满足累计消费净额的要求。
一旦达到累计最低消费额，免费停车福利将自动存入会员的 IU 中。
当车辆驶出停车场时，相当于免费停车时间的停车费将自动从实际的停车费中扣除。
点击这里，了解享有免费停车福利的最低消费额详情
我需要消费多少才能享有每日 2 小时停车福利？
普通/黄金级/铂金级会员在樟宜机场 1 号航站楼至 4 号航站楼公共区域参与活动的门店（不包括星耀樟宜，但包括航站楼超市），同一天累计净消费达到 S$60可免费停车 2 小时，公定假期前夕及公定假期除外。
普通/黄金级/铂金级会员光顾星耀樟宜参与活动的门店（包括超市），同一天累计净消费达到  S$80可免费停车 2 小时，公定假期前夕及公定假期除外。
会员务必在交易时扫描其奖励卡，以便累计所规定的消费净额并兑换免费停车福利。
如果我同一天在 1 号航站楼至 4 号航站楼的参与商家进行了 3 笔交易，总消费额达到 S$60 (所有 3 笔交易都扫描了奖励卡)，那 2 小时免费停车福利会自动存入我的樟宜奖励计划帐户吗？
只要所有 3 笔交易都扫描了奖励卡，免费停车福利就会自动存入并反映在My CarPass > My eCoupons上。为避免任何不便，请记得在进行每笔交易时扫描您的奖励卡。
如果我在 1 号航站楼至 4 号航站楼消费了 S$50 ，又在星耀樟宜消费了 S$30，累计是 S$80，我仍然有资格获得 2 小时免费停车福利吗？
不，1 号航站楼至 4 号航站楼和星耀樟宜的累积消费额不可合计。只有在 1 号航站楼至 4 号航站楼的公共区域累计消费净额满 S$60 及/或在星耀樟宜的累计消费净额满 S$80，才能获得 2 小时免费停车福利。
如果我在星耀樟宜消费，我能在所有航站楼停车场使用我的 2 小时免费停车福利吗？
不，凭在星耀樟宜的累计消费额只能在 1 号航站楼 - 星耀樟宜停车场（普通停车位 – B3 至 B5）获得 2 小时免费停车福利。
如果我在 5 月 2 日（驶入）至 5 月3 日（驶出）期间停车，并且两天（5 月 2 日及 5 月 3 日）都符合规定的消费标准，我在 5 月 3 日驶出指定停车场时能否享有总共 4 小时免费停车福利？
不，每次驶出停车场只能使用一次 2 小时的免费停车福利。您获得的第二张 2 小时免费停车 My eCoupon 可以在您下次使用樟宜机场的指定停车场时使用，只要您在 My eCoupon 的有效期内驶出即可。
每笔交易/每张收据是否有最低金额要求，才能符合樟宜奖励计划的 2 小时免费停车福利？
是的，在樟宜机场 1 号航站楼至 4 号航站楼的公共区域或星耀樟宜的每笔交易/每张收据的最低消费净额满 S$10，才可享有樟宜奖励计划的 2 小时免费停车福利。
有哪些非参与商家不符合凭消费额换取樟宜奖励计划停车福利的资格？
樟宜奖励计划停车福利的非参与商家与赚取樟宜奖励计划积分的排除商家名单相同。您可以参考樟宜奖励计划条款与条件第 4.8 条款的完整非参与商家名单。
我已经使用樟宜奖励计划积分兑换了现有的停车费回扣，另外我也享有凭最低消费额兑换的 2 小时免费停车福利。在我驶出停车场时，哪一项停车福利会首先被使用？
根据停车福利及 My eCoupon 的优先顺序，首先使用凭最低消费额兑换的免费停车福利，然后才是您现有的停车回扣。
会员可通过 My CarPass 核实他们享有停车回扣、特权或福利的资格。请注意，优先级顺序会不时改变，会员可访问https://carpass.changiairport.com/FAQ.html了解最新信息。
如果我的车辆信息改变，比如有了新的车牌号码或车内阅卡器（IU）号码，我该怎么做？
如果需要更改车内阅卡器（IU）号码，您可以通过 My CarPass 门户网站更新车辆的信息。请注意，您在樟宜奖励计划会员帐户中注册的 IU 号码将会随着更新的 IU 号码而改变，并且此更新将适用于您所有现有的 My eCoupon、停车特权及停车费优惠，以及通过 My CarPass 门户网站进行的未来停车费兑换。
我可否注册多个车内阅卡器（IU）号码到我的樟宜奖励计划帐户？
不行。您只能将一个 IU 号码注册到您的樟宜奖励计划帐户。每个 IU 号码只能注册到一个樟宜奖励计划帐户上。如果 IU 号码属于共享车辆，您可先将 IU 号码从原来的樟宜奖励计划帐户删除，然后再更新到另一个樟宜奖励计划帐户上。
如果我的樟宜奖励计划停车福利在指定的停车场未被扣除，我该如何处理？
请先驶出停车场并支付完整的停车费，然后通过反馈表网页表单向我们提供相关状况的详情。我们的团队将会进行调查并与您联系，以提供解决方案。

受邀参加独家活动及体验
我可以预订梦蝶客会员的免费预留停车位吗？
梦蝶客会员预留车位遵循先到先得的原则分配。每个停车场共有 3 个预留车位。更多关于专属车位的详情可查阅此处。梦蝶客会员需将梦蝶客会员车贴粘在已注册 IU 号码的车辆上，未经许可停放的车辆（即未贴有梦蝶客会员车贴的车辆）将可能遭受轮锁处理。
梦蝶客会员停车车贴有使用期限吗？
梦蝶客会员将会获得一个梦蝶客会员车贴，该车贴需要粘贴在已注册 IU 号码的车辆上。若要使用梦蝶客会员的免费预留停车位，此车贴是必备条件。车贴将于梦蝶客会员级别结束期日失效（具体日期载于所发放的车贴上）。符合资格并成功重新获得梦蝶客会员级别的会员将在之后重新获发新的车贴。
如何管理未经许可停放的车辆？
如有疑问，樟宜机场集团（CAG）和/或其停车场合作伙伴（威信停车场）有权在梦蝶客会员预留车位处要求车主出示其他形式的身份证明文件。樟宜机场集团有权在合理怀疑停车行为存在欺诈或不符合条款与条件时，随时自行决定撤销任何停车特权，且在任何情况下，樟宜机场集团的决定为最终决定。
我能将梦蝶客会员全年免费停车权益转让给他人吗？
该权益将自动记入与梦蝶客会员档案绑定的车内阅卡器（IU）号码中。若梦蝶客会员档案中没有绑定的 IU 号码，持卡人将无法享受停车权益。此项权益不可转让给他人。
梦蝶客会员全年免费停车适用于哪些停车场？
梦蝶客会员全年免费停车停车场包括：2 号航站楼停车场 - 2A 与 2B 停车场；3 号航站楼停车场 - 3A 与 3B 停车场；4 号航站楼停车场 - 4A 与 4B 停车场；1 号航站楼与星耀樟宜停车场（限 B3 至 B5 普通车位）。
使用梦蝶客会员预留停车位是否有停车时间限制？
是的，梦蝶客卡持卡人使用任何指定的梦蝶客预留停车位的时间，自进入相关停车场之日起最多不得超过24小时，以便腾出预留车位，供更多梦蝶客卡持卡人使用。任何车辆停放在梦蝶客专属停车位超过 24 小时，将会被锁轮，且须遵守机场停车条款与条件细则中所载的现行费用标准向樟宜机场集团（CAG）支付相关费用以移除锁轮装置。梦蝶客持卡人可在相关停车场的非预留停车位停车，没有停车时间限制。梦蝶客会员可在非预留停车免费停车。

常见问题
参与的航空公司
什么是 樟宜机场行李追踪器?
樟宜行李追踪器是由樟宜机场集团（CAG）推出的服务，旨在为出发、抵达和中转的旅客提供行李在樟宜机场运输过程中的状态更新。
我输入了行李牌号码，却没有找到我的行李。
您的航空公司可能尚未参与樟宜行李追踪服务（请点击此处查看参与的航空公司名单），但我们正持续与在樟宜机场运营的航空公司合作，力求让更多航空公司加入该服务。如您认为这是系统错误，请发送电邮至enquiry@changiairport.com，或通过行李追踪器内的意见反馈窗口提交反馈。
我在航班结束后多久还能追踪我的行李？
最多可追踪达 3 天。
这个服务和我的航空公司提供的行李追踪有什么不同吗？
您航空公司和我们的行李追踪器提供的信息可能类似。航空公司可能会提供只有他们掌握的额外信息，而我们的追踪器则可能显示与机场设施整合的相关资讯。
“Loaded” 是什么意思？
“Loaded”的中文翻译是，“已装载”而此状态表示您的托运行李已被放入运往您所搭乘航班的集装箱或行李拖车中。
行李是如何被追踪的？
樟宜行李追踪器结合了您所搭乘航空公司提供的信息，以及樟宜机场的行李处理系统数据，为您呈现行李在樟宜机场的运输过程。
我是中转旅客，为什么行李追踪器显示我的行李将被送往樟宜机场的行李提领带？
请前往中转柜台咨询并确认您的行李是否已直挂至最终目的地。

从 2025 年 7 月 7 日至 9 月 30 日，旅途中别忘了犒赏自己！在樟宜机场离境转机区域（1 至 4 号航站楼）参与活动的门店，单张收据消费满 S$100，即可获赠一张 S$10 樟宜回程电子现金券。
下次从樟宜机场出发时，出示您的樟宜奖励计划会员卡与有效登机证，即可在新罗免税店或乐天免税店兑换使用。
促销活动仅在店内有效，不适用于樟宜我爱购。消费金额不包括 Changi Pay 樟宜电子现金券、樟宜奖励计划积分及其他店内促销或折扣。参与者须为樟宜奖励计划会员。其他条款与条件适用。
欲享受促销优惠，只需：
满足过境区域（1 至 4 号航站楼）内任何参与门店以单张收据满 S$100 的最低消费要求，以及
为现有的樟宜奖励计划会员
如果您目前不是樟宜奖励计划会员，您可以在购物之前在此下载应用程序以注册成为会员:https://changi.me/mcchangiapp，并在付款时扫描您的奖励卡。在购物时必须扫描奖励卡，才能在会员帐户中获得樟宜回程电子现金券。
欲兑换樟宜回程电子现金券，只需：
向新罗和乐天的收银员出示您的有效登机证以及您的樟宜奖励计划卡进行扫描，即可在交易中使用您的樟宜回程电子现金券。
樟宜回程电子现金券仅限于您下次从樟宜机场出发时，在离境大厅（1 至 4 号航站楼）内的新罗免税店或乐天免税店内使用。不适用于樟宜我爱购。它也不能用于购买任何烟草产品。参与活动的门店可能会排除某些产品。
此次促销活动的参与门店有哪些？
过境区域（1 至 4 号航站楼）内的所有转机餐饮和零售店。促销不适用于购买服务。
如何符合条件参加促销活动？
在过境区域内任何参与活动的门店以单张收据满 S$100 的最低消费，并且为现有的樟宜奖励计划会员，您就有资格参与促销活动。这是因为樟宜回程电子现金券将通过 Changi App 发放给您。
如果您目前不是樟宜奖励计划会员，您可以在购物之前注册，并在付款时扫描您的奖励卡。在购物时必须扫描奖励卡，才能在会员帐户中获得樟宜回程电子现金券。
我必须是新加坡公民才能享受此促销活动吗？
不须要。欲获得参加本次促销活动的资格，您只需满足最低消费要求，即可获得樟宜回程电子现金券。
如果我在两张不同的收据上消费 S$200，我是否有权获得 2 张 S$10 的樟宜回程电子现金券？
活动资格是基于每天每位樟宜奖励计划会员一张收据上的最低消费。您不能将多张收据合并以达到最低消费额，也不能在同一天内收到超过两张 S$10 的樟宜回程电子现金券。因此，只要您在单张收据中达到 S$100 的最低消费，您当天就会获得一张 S$10 的樟宜回程电子现金券。
此促销活动中是否每位客户仅限获得一张樟宜回程电子现金券？
每一位达到最低消费的樟宜奖励计划会员每天都有资格获得一张樟宜回程电子现金券。如果樟宜奖励计划会员在另一天的另一张收据上再次达到最低消费，则该顾客仍可获得另一张 S$10 的樟宜回程电子现金券。
我有资格参加此次促销活动，并在樟宜奖励计划帐户中获得了樟宜回程电子现金券。我在下一次出境新加坡时兑换了樟宜回程电子现金券。与此同时，我在过境区域的单张收据中达到了最低消费。我是否将因为这次交易而获得另一张樟宜回程电子现金券？
是，每位樟宜奖励计划会员每天可获得一张樟宜回程电子现金券。如果樟宜奖励计划会员在活动期间从新加坡出境 5 次，则可获得 5 张 S$10 的樟宜回程电子现金券（前提是每次旅行都达到最低消费）。这也取决于樟宜回程电子现金券是否仍可供发放。
将如何发放樟宜回程电子现金券？
一旦您符合资格，樟宜回程电子现金券将自动发放到您的樟宜奖励计划帐户中，您可以通过 Changi App 访问该帐户。樟宜回程电子现金券可在您的 Changi App 帐户的“现金券、奖品和兑换”下找到。
我满足了最低消费，因此有资格参加促销活动，但我在我的樟宜奖励计划帐户中没有看到樟宜回程电子现金券。为什么？
樟宜回程电子现金券将在完成合格购物 24 小时后通过 Changi App 自动发放至您的樟宜奖励计划帐户中。如果 24 小时后仍没有显示樟宜回程电子现金券，请通过此处的线上表单提交查询：https://www.changiairport.com/zh/rewards/feedback.html
我可以在哪里兑换樟宜回程电子现金券？
樟宜回程电子现金券只能在离境转机大厅（1 至 4 号航站楼）内的新罗免税店和乐天免税店内兑换。不适用于樟宜我爱购。它也不能用于购买任何烟草产品。
如何兑换樟宜回程电子现金券？
您将在 Changi App 上收到“优惠”，并引导您至您的樟宜奖励计划卡。欲兑换樟宜回程电子现金券，只需向新罗和乐天的收银员出示您的樟宜奖励计划卡进行扫描，即可在交易中使用您的樟宜回程电子现金券。
我在樟宜奖励计划卡中累积了多张樟宜回程电子现金券。我可以叠加使用现金券吗？
不可以，樟宜回程电子现金券不能在一张收据上叠加使用。樟宜回程电子现金券可按每位樟宜奖励计划会员每笔交易 1 张的标准进行使用。因此，如果您的樟宜奖励计划帐户中有 5 张樟宜回程电子现金券，只要您在同一天进行 5 笔交易，您就可以在同一天使用全部 5 张樟宜回程电子现金券。
是否有任何品牌限制？
对于新罗免税店，不参与活动的品牌包括香奈儿和迪奥。乐天免税店不排除任何品牌，但樟宜回程电子现金券不能用于购买任何烟草产品。
如果我使用 Changi Pay 樟宜回程电子现金券和樟宜奖励计划积分抵扣消费，该部分金额是否仍会计入最低消费额和/或累计净消费？
不会。Changi Pay 樟宜回程电子现金券、樟宜奖励计划积分及其他店内促销、折扣和/或优惠的应用均不计入最低消费额和/或累计净消费。

在安全的服务器上存储您的个人数据；以及
基于“需要知道”原则限制个人数据的访问权限。

10. 个人数据 – 访问和更正
请您确保我们收集的数据的准确性——您承诺您将提供准确和完整的个人数据，并不时更新向我方提供的该等个人数据。在向我方提供个人数据之前，您应当仔细检查您向我方提供的信息是否完整、准确。

The information and materials on the Event are provided to the Participant for information purposes only and on an “as is” and “as available” basis without representations, warranties or guarantees of any kind either express or implied.
11.2 The Organiser makes no representation, warranty or guarantee:
(i) That the Official Website is appropriate or available for use in all countries or that the content complies with the laws of all countries. The Participant is responsible for ensuring that his/her access to and use of the Official Website is not illegal or prohibited by and complies with, the laws of the jurisdiction in which he/she is accessing the Official Website;
(ii) That the Official Website will be compatible with all hardware, software and operating system which the Participant may use; and/or
(iii) About the quality, suitability, safety or reliability of the Organiser or its contractor’s services.
11.3 While the Organiser and their contractors endeavour to make the Official Website available 24 hours a day, the Organiser and their contractors make no representation, warranty or guarantee that the Participant’s access to the Official Website will be uninterrupted, timely or error-free. The Organiser or their contractors may carry out repairs, maintenance or introduce new facilities and functions from time to time, which may cause interruptions or other downtimes in the Participant’s access to the Official Website. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Organiser and their contractors disclaim all representations and warranties, whether express or implied, statutory or otherwise, and shall not be liable to any person if for any reason the Official Website is unavailable for any time or for any period, or if the use or access of the Official Website is interrupted or is performing slowly, or for any errors in or omission from, any information made available through the Official Website.
11.4 To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Organiser and their contractors shall not be liable to the Participant or any other person for any damage, claim, liability, expense or cost, arising out of or in connection with:
(i) Any person’s access and/or use of the Official Website and/or Event account using the Participant’s username and/or login password;
(ii) Any exposure to malicious software including but not limited to, viruses, computer worms, Trojan horses, spyware or other harmful forms of interference which may damage the Participant’s computer system, mobile device, software, data or other property or that may expose him/her to fraud when he/she accesses or uses the Official Website and/or the Event account. For the avoidance of doubt, the Participant shall be responsible for installing and maintaining all necessary anti-virus or other anti-malicious software and taking other necessary precautions to ensure the safety and integrity of the process by which he/she accesses and uses the Official Website and/or the Event account from such malware; and/or
(iii) Any site linked from the Official Website and/or the Event account. Any link on the Official Website and/or the Event account to other sites does not imply any endorsement, approval or recommendation of, or responsibility for, those sites or their contents, operations, products or operators.
12.GPS APP AND USAGE
12.1 For non-treadmill results that are submitted to the Organiser for the Virtual Run Fundraising Challenge, the Participant must submit the results via designated GPS-based mobile apps used to track athletic activity via satellite navigation and then upload and share such activities. The compatible GPS-enabled apps to clock the running distance, time, and route for the run are STRAVA and GARMIN. If a Participant uses other GPS- enabled apps, the Participant may need to manually upload the information onto the  Website. The Organiser reserves the right to reject any such manually uploaded data if they have reasonable grounds to believe that the data has been tampered with or altered.
12.2 As with any GPS app or mobile data device, the accuracy of the location information shown on the tracking panel depends on, amongst other things, the quality of the connection between the Participant’s device and the GPS satellites and the connection with the mobile phone network. These can be affected by environmental factors such as bad weather or the presence of tall buildings and information can be delayed, corrupted or lost. The information on the tracking panel is therefore to be regarded as being a guide to the location of the device at the time of the last update received from it and is subject to error. The use of the device and any of the GPS exercise tracking apps will be the responsibility of the Participant, and at the Participant’s own risk. The Organiser does not take any responsibility for the use of the device nor any GPS exercise tracking app, nor for any injury or death that may be caused to the Participant from such use. The usage of GPS routes is to showcase the distance completed by the Participant based on results submitted to ensure fair play among all Participants. If at any time the Organiser believes that a Participant has breached the Terms and Conditions or the terms of any other agreement with them or are using the Participant’s device and the GPS exercise tracking app in an improper or illegal manner or otherwise in a manner as to materially adversely affect the Official Website and/or Event account, the Organiser may immediately terminate or suspend the Participant’s use of the Event account and/or Official Website without notice.
12.3 For treadmill results, the Participant must manually submit their results via the Official Website, accompanied by clear and accurate photo evidence in accordance with the submission guidelines. The Organiser reserves the right to reject any manually submitted data if there are reasonable grounds to believe that the data is incomplete, inaccurate, tampered with, or otherwise does not comply with the stated guidelines.13.PRIVACY
13.1 By continuing to use the Organiser's services relating to the Event, accessing any part of the Official Website, registering for the Event, submitting information to the Organiser (and/ or its related entities) whether for the purpose of registering for the Event, donating or otherwise in relation to the Event, and in addition to the personal data protection consent having been executed by the Participant, the Participant expressly agrees and consents to the Organiser's (including its related entities, as well as their respective agents') collection, use and disclosure of his/her personal data for all and any purposes relating to the Event (“Purposes”), including but not limited to the following:

If a modification is not possible, the provision shall be treated for all purposes as severed from the Terms and Conditions. The remainder of the Terms and Conditions shall remain in full force and effect and continue to be binding and enforceable on you.

Shop guilt-free with GST-absorbed purchases at the public areas in the airport.
GST in Singapore has increased to 9% from 1st January 2024. Participating retail outlets in Changi Airport will continue to absorb GST for retail spends in public areas of Terminals 1 to 4 for eligible Changi Rewards members.
How It Works
Sample receipt:
For GST-registered retail outlets, the display price includes GST. Therefore, in this sample transaction, GST would already be included in the price of the item (SGD100).
Highlighted green label is the discount equivalent to a 9% GST amount based on GST-inclusive pricing (9/109 x SGD100 = SGD8.26).
The final price of the item is SGD100 - SGD8.26 = SGD91.74.
